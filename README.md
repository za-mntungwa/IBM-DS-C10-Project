In this capstone project, a predictive model to forecast the successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage during SpaceX rocket launches was developed, as it significantly impacts the cost-effectiveness of each launch. Using Python, JSON data was manipulated to analyse trends. This data science driven approach aims to inform strategic decision-making in aerospace competitive bidding.
